    <p style="color:rgb(0, 63, 63); font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">“Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms "weather" and "climate" are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales.</p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 108, 108) ; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">What is Global Warming?</h3>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 63, 63); font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly measured as the average increase in Earth’s global surface temperature.</p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 108, 108) ; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">What is Climate Change?</h3>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 63, 63); font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.
        Changes observed in Earth’s climate since the early 20th century are primarily driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere, raising Earth’s average surface temperature. These human-produced temperature increases are commonly referred to as global warming. Natural processes can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El Niño, La Niña and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, changes in the Sun’s energy output, variations in Earth’s orbit).</p>

        <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 108, 108) ; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">How can it be reduced?</h3>
        <p style="color:rgb(0, 63, 63); font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Mochiy Pop P One', sans-serif;">Mitigation – reducing climate change – involves reducing the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, either by reducing sources of these gases (for example, the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat or transport) or enhancing the “sinks” that accumulate and store these gases (such as the oceans, forests and soil). The goal of mitigation is to avoid significant human interference with the climate system, and “stabilize greenhouse gas levels in a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner” (from the 2014 report on Mitigation of Climate Change from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
